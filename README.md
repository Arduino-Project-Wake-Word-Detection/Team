<b>Project name: </b> COMP 554 Fall 20 TinyML Final Project: Wake Word Detection <br>

<b>Team members:</b> <br>
Chih-Che Chung (cc128) <br>
Wenbai Cheng (wc47) <br>
Weihao Huang (wh28) <br>

<b>Goal:</b><br>
We built an embedded voice recognition application by using Arduino Nano 33 to take an one-second voice as input and classify it. 
Our device will light the red or green LED for 3 seconds when hearing the word "stop" or "go" respectively.

To view the codes, please go to "StopGo/micro_speech/" director.
